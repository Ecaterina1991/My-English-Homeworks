          There is a Romanian slogan which is saying "What you have got without
          silver, give without silver further". I do not believe in the fortune
          that you can get without any effort. But if it would happen luckily,
          you can give you the chance to grow your own business on your own
          field work and after that to take the advantages. I know people that
          had a fortune, like they could buy a house for each of their children
          and help them to start their own businesses, but they decided to keep
          the money for themselves and then the monetary system suddenly changed
          and they have lost everything. Some people might get very sick because
          of this kind of stress and the conclusion in this case would be that a
          fortune can kill you.
        </p>

          The Universe does not recompense selfishness, not bad intentions, not
          materialism. The Universe will recompense with a 1 million times plus
          scaling the ones who are thinking in a good way and are doing good
          things.
        </p>
        <p>
          Also, I think that a little nice gesture can value more than 10
          million euro. For example, to take in your car an old man who is
          waiting in the street under a rainbow with an outstretched hand or to
          treat really nice a person who have a much lower social statute than
          you have.
        </p>
        <p>
          If I would win 10 million euro, with a part of the money I would try
          to build my own business in programming. Specifically, I would build a
          programming school for children and adults. I would hire some good
          programmers skilled in explaining the theory and practice. I could be
          one of the teachers. It would have two versions of existing. One
          version would be online, and the other one, in the campus. The online
          version should exist also in English for all the people around the
          world. Also, I could manage to organise some summer camps in Constanta
          for children, so as they would have fun at the sea in the early
          morning and in the evening, but do some interactive interesting boot
          camp on programming a few hours during the day. The campus activities
          of programming could happen in a big pavilion, so that parents would
          know that their children are spending a lot of time outside breathing
          fresh air.
        </p>
        <p>
          There would be programming campus and graphic design campus so that
          the children that are too small to understand programming could
          exercise their skills in the graphic design field. The graphic design
          campus would have also a painting instructor to teach them the basics
          of the drawing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Also, I would open a painting gallery with the pictures of my mother
          in Constanta and I would sell tickets to visitors.
        </p>
        <p>
          If my business would work, I would make some improvement to my house.
          I would change the roof and maybe I would finish building my second
          floor of the house. Maybe I would buy for myself the cheapest electric
          car or maybe not.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another part of the money I would invest in some big programming
          companies to implement a system of automatically collecting of the
          garbage from outside spaces: from the lakes and seas and oceans, and
          also from the streets.
        </p>
        <p>
          I would invest a part of the money to implement an automatic system of
          collecting expired medications in relation with the government, to
          reduce the global pollution.
        </p>
        <p>
          I could build a hospital and donate it to the state, so as poor people
          from my town would have access to a normal and safe hospital, but I
          think it would change nothing, because the problem is in the
          corruption, so in the people and in their mentality. All corrupted
          doctors should be dismissed and be substituted with a new generation
          of doctors, with a right mentality. You cannot change a doctor who is
          used to take money from the patients. Maybe the Romanian medical
          system needs the same change that the Romanian army supported when
          NATO was implemented and all communist soldiers were supposed to get
          retired.
        </p>
        <p>
          I would build a naturist treatment resort where the patient would be
          treated with fresh natural plants that I would grow in my own plant
          greenhouse, and I would open some exclusively naturist pharmacies that
          would be in a direct collaboration with my plant greenhouse.
        </p>
        <p>
          I would contact the government representatives to try to invest a part
          of my money in building in mountains a machine that is generating snow
          based on a solar panel system to keep the balance of the natural
          Biosystems in the world and I would try to get some support from
          European and American government to implement this mechanism all
          around the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          I would try to help agriculture to avoid drought by building above the
          ground solar panel systems so that the plants would not dry out
          because of the sunlight and the energy that would be generated in this
          way I would use to feed artificial irrigation systems. The rest of the
          energy would be sent to the towns and villages with a very small
          price, to help the economy of people and businesses.
        </p>
        <p>I would build a shelter for stray animals.</p>
        <p>
          That’s what I would do if I would win 10 million euro, because if you
          are doing good things, good things will happen to you and if you are
          thinking just about your comfort, the Universe will punish you.

      <h1>First Homework</h1>
      <div class="first-homework">
        <p>
          I am used to start my day by hearing my one year daughter voice which
          is calling me “maaaama” in a very sweet way. She wakes up early in the
          morning when I still want to sleep, but her voice is so warm that I
          don’t feel dizzy anymore and I can start my day. Then we are playing
          while my mother is preparing some morning tea and sandwiches and give
          some food for our dog named Leu. After that, we are taking together
          our breakfast. When she is full, she is trying to feed me with hers
          food.
        </p>
        <p>
          The next our move is that one which is chosen by little Daria and she
          is going to the door from the back of our house and start playing with
          the keys, so she is telling us that she wants to go outside. Everybody
          is getting dressed fast and in a few minutes we are already outside,
          with a tea and some cereals.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here, in our yard, Daria is really active. She is looking after the
          broom and scope to make sounds everywhere and she is bubbling the
          broom in the water and she is trying to find any piece of the dog food
          to make it her talisman, and she is really happy if finds some piece,
          but I am trying to sweep everything.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then she wants a milk and maybe some sleep, after the lunch. My mother
          is doing a soup for us and when Daria falls asleep, we also are
          sleeping to recover from the night awakenings.
        </p>
        <p>
          At 15:00 o’clock I am drinking 20 ml coffee with milk so I could learn
          until 00:00 a.m. Then I am playing with Daria in our living room. We
          are jumping and hugging and having a lot of fun. After that my husband
          comes home from the work and we are playing with Daria until 17:00.
          From 17:00 to 18:00 I am studying and then my mother is preparing the
          dinner while we are playing with Daria by watching the news. Then we
          are taking our dinner, and starting with 20:00 until 00:00, I have my
          learning program.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I am working on some project, the midnight finds me very
          captivated by my work and I do not really want to sleep, but I know
          that this is what I should, do, so I am forcing myself to go to bed
          and I have a pretty good sleep for the moment.
        </p>
        <p>
          In conclusion, I have a beautiful and healthy life, full of positive
          emotions, with a great family and friends and with this amazing
          opportunity of doing this beautiful course.
